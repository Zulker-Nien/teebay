## Walkthrough

### ROOT BASIC FILES

#### index.ts

The entry point is wrapped with Apollo Client and Browser router.
The Apollo Client receives a client information property from ApolloClient.tsx stored in the src folder

#### App.ts

This is the file where you can configure and edit the routes.
The route file is wrapped with a ToastContainer which configures how the notification would be displayed. Any changes on the look of the notifaction must be done here to keep uniformity over the system.
Finally, states from MOBX store enable the simple string matching which helps users to route to different pages.

#### Notice that maximum exports have an observer function through out the front-end to provide seamless stateChange.

#### Home.ts

This file consists the showCase of buy or sell page based on state from MOBX. If authorization isn't complete, the user would be navigated back to the login page.

## Components

### 1. Ui

Three UI Components namely MenuToggle, Navbar and SearchBar were kept separate.

### 2. Types

This folder holds all the types and interfaces required.

### 3. Queries

All Graphql queries were made here.

#### - addProduct

Mutates product information and adds product to the database.

#### - buyProduct

Let's you buy a product once the confirm modal is clicked

#### (Apollo Caching here helps to update the cache information and show an instantaneous result.)

#### - deleteProduct

Let's you delete product data based on the id clicked

#### (Apollo Caching here helps to evict the cache information and show an instantaneous result.)

#### - editProduct

This query takes an id from the selected product and runs a mutation to update the product

#### ownedProduct

#### - signUpUser

#### - loginUser

### 4. Forms

4 forms were used:

#### a. AddProductForm.tsx

This form handles the creation of a new product.

#### (Apollo Caching is used here and it helps to update the cache information and show an instantaneous result in the frontend as cards.)

#### b. EditProductForm.tsx

This form handles the update of a new product.

#### c. SignUpForm.tsx

This form handles the creation of a user.

#### d. LoginForm.tsx

This form handles the login of a user.

The Material UI components are fairly straightforward but one thing to note is that the Select component(which is the dropdown) changes based on a React changeEvent. The Options and Categories use the select component.
